## Welcome to Northern Wisconsin BIPOC Support

To better understand the problems facing our community- and to find solutions to those issues- we are providing an area for community members to submit stories of personal experiences that have felt inapporpriate, discriminatory, or unsafe. You can choose to remain anonymous or share your name. You can also choose whether you would like your story shared publicly or with support groups located in this website

[Submit an Anonymous Story](https://github.com/bluejay046/bipoc-support/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bluejay046/bipoc-support/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
